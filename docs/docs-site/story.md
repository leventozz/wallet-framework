Why did I want to build such a framework?

I have been working as a software developer in the finance sector for a long time. This has given me the opportunity to develop code and gain experience in many fintech projects. In doing so, I realized that common problems were always being solved using different methods. The biggest reason for this problem was time constraints. Therefore, throughout my career, I tried to solve these problems as best I could under a single framework.
At the same time, this would also help me in future tasks.

My goal was not to create a product with every feature completed. I just wanted to prepare a guide that a software developer who is confused about such a structure or looking for alternatives could refer to. While developing this framework, I made sure to include at least one example of the most commonly used features. This way, I aimed to make it easy to add any other missing features.

I am still developing this framework, so please feel free to contribute. You can also use the code as you see fit.
