Hello everyone,

On these web pages, I will try to explain the Wallet Framework to you without overwhelming you with code. 
In the first section, I will briefly explain what the Wallet Framework does.From now on, I will refer to the Wallet Framework as ‘WF’ throughout those pages.
WF is a framework designed for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions commonly used in the financial sector and their tracking (via an admin panel).
The goal is to use appropriate architecture and technologies while performing these operations. 

WF's capabilities include:
* P2P transfers
* Internal Fraud Controls
* Audit logs
* Full metric observability
* An admin panel for managing customers and transactions
* Role-based authorization
* Secret management using a secret vault
* Full dockerization


If you'd like, I'd also like to briefly mention why I felt the need to do this:
